I'm sorry, can you please, repeat yourself?
Well, before I give you my account information, I just wanna let you know that I'm really pissed.  I can't access my email for almost a week now. I'm paying you guys lots of money, and you can't even provide a decent service. What's wrong with you people? YOUR SERVICE SUCKS!!!
Sure, my account number is 860-995-****
It's Robert W. Smith, I am the account holder.
I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time hearing, can you please, repeat yourself?
Yes, that's a good call back number.
I've gone through the steps, believe me, I've checked everything before calling you!
Fine! I have Power and Ethernet lights green on my modem. But, the 3rd light is flashing red, which is the DSL light. Are you happy now?
Well, that's good then, I'll be a happy camper!
It's right behind my desk, do you want me to crawl down the floor again?
Ok, but, this is the last step that I'll do. Don't hang up.
Oh my goodness, the gray phone cord was just loose, let me plug that in...  Oh my, there's now a steady green light on the DSL light of the modem, let me just try now the Internet!
Jerry, you are a miracle worker! Thank you so much! It got me now on my homepage and email!
I feel so stupid for calling you about this. But, I surely appreciate your time and patience!
